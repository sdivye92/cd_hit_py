# cd_hit_py

Python interface to <a href="http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit-web-server/cgi-bin/index.cgi?cmd=cd-hit">cd-hit</a> clustering program.

See [example](https://github.com/sdivye92/cd_hit_py/tree/master/example) for basic commands.

The cd-hit executable files are taken from [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/cd-hit/files). Therefore, these will execute on linux and OSX distributions only.

This project is still not made into python package. Therfore, to try example run following commands

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sdivye92/cd_hit_py.git
mv cd_hit_py cd_hit
cp cd_hit/example/* ./*
```
